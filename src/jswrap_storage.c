Write/create a file in the flash storage area. This is
nonvolatile and will not disappear when the device resets
or power is lost.

Simply write `require("Storage").write("MyFile", "Some data")` to write
a new file, and `require("Storage").read("MyFile")` to read it.

If you supply:

* A String, it will be written as-is
* An array, will be written as a byte array (but read back as a String)
* An object, it will automatically be converted to
a JSON string before being written.

You may also create a file and then populate data later **as long as you
don't try and overwrite data that already exists**. For instance:

```
var f = require("Storage");
f.write("a","Hello",0,14);
f.write("a"," ",5);
f.write("a","World!!!",6);
print(f.read("a"));
```

This can be useful if you've got more data to write than you
have RAM available.

The Flash Storage system is journaling. To make the most of the limited
write cycles of Flash memory, Espruino marks deleted/replaced files as
garbage and moves on to a fresh part of flash memory. Espruino only
fully erases those files when it is running low on flash, or when
`compact` is called.

`compact` may fail if there isn't enough RAM free on the stack to
use as swap space, however in this case it will not lose data.

**Note:** `compact` rearranges the contents of memory. If code is
referencing that memory (eg. functions that have their code stored in flash)
then they may become garbled when compaction happens. To avoid this,
call `eraseFiles` before uploading data that you intend to reference to
ensure that uploaded files are right at the start of flash and cannot be
compacted further.
